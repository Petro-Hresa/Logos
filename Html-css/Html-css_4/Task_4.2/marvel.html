			<hr>
			<p>Marvel Comics is the brand name and primary imprint of Marvel Worldwide Inc., formerly Marvel Publishing, Inc.
				and Marvel Comics Group, a publisher of American comic books and related media. In 2009, The Walt Disney Company
				acquired Marvel
				Entertainment, Marvel Worldwide's parent company. Marvel started in 1939 as Timely Publications, and by the
				early 1950s, had generally become known as Atlas Comics. The Marvel branding began in 1961, the year that the
				company launched
				The Fantastic Four and other superhero titles created by Steve Ditko, Stan Lee, Jack Kirby and many others.
				Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as Spider-Man, Captain America, Iron Man, Thor,
				Wolverine, the
				Hulk, Daredevil, Ghost Rider, Deadpool, Doctor Strange, Black Panther and the Punisher, such teams as the
				Avengers, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four and the Guardians of the Galaxy, and antagonists including Doctor Doom,
				Red Skull, Green
				Goblin, Thanos, Ultron, Doctor Octopus, Magneto, Venom and Loki. Most of Marvel's fictional characters operate
				in a single reality known as the Marvel Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
				characters
				are based in New York City.
